# Mini project for course "Programmering af interaktive 3D verdener"

This mini projected resulted in my take on a typical indie horror game akin to "Granny" or "Slender". The game is quite simple: Collect 4 keys located around the asylum and get out while avoiding the monster roaming the asylum. All 3D assets and the music were imported from the unity asset store except from the keys, which were quickly made in blender. The monster scream is a royalty free sound downloaded from here: https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/demonic-woman-scream-6333/ and the old paper texture was made by akalezz88: https://www.deviantart.com/akaleez88/art/old-paper-photo-texture-2-110463965.

Controls:
WASD to move
Shift to sprint
E to interact with keys and front door (when you have 4 keys)
P or ESC to pause
